# ACCIDENT-DASHBOARD
An accident dataset gotten from kaggle and Power BI for visualization to drive meaningful insight on road safety measures and usage to decrease accident risk and life management. The dataset consist of 200 rows and 6 columns, with missing values in columns like Speed of Impact and Gender. In the process of visualization I filled up missing values with fill down and fill up respectively, and used visualization tools like bar chart and pie charts. I created a new column Age category using measure in Power BI to group Age for clarity.
 
# Features:

•	Age: different ages 
•	Gender: Male or Female
•	Speed of Impact: count of speed covered
•	Used of helmet:  different gender that used helmet
•	Used of Seatbelt: different gender that used seatbelt
•	Survived: number of survived

# Objectives:

•	Identify gender with high survival rate
•	Identify gender with high accident rate
•	Analyze how use of helmet and use of seatbelt contribute to accident
•	Identify age and survival rate
•	Analyze impact of speed by gender and survival rate

# Dashboard Highlight:

•	Survival rate by gender:
•	Gender with more survival rate
•	Survival rate by Age Category:
•	Age category with high or low survival rate
•	Speed of Impact and survived:
•	High or Low Speed of Impact link with high or low survival
•	Safety Measures by Speed of Impact and Survived: 
•	Safety Measures contribute to Survival rate with Speed limit
•	Speed of Impact and Survived by Age Category and Gender:
•	Gender grouped by Age Category with Average Speed of Impact and Survived

# Key Metrics:

•	Male gender survived with 51.
•	Female Survived with 50.
•	Adult survived with 80.2%.
•	Youth survived with 19.8%.
•	Complete safety kits survived with 32 at Average speed of 68.09.
•	Used of Helmet without Seatbelt survived with 22 at average speed of 73.33.
•	Used of Seatbelt without Helmet survived with 27 at average speed of 73.93.
•	Without any safety kits survival rate is 20 at average speed of 66.57.
•	Female Adult survived more with 42 at average speed of 74.40.
•	Male Adult survived with 39 at average speed of 71.80.
•	Female youth survived with 8 at average speed of 62.14.
•	Male Youth survived with 12 at average speed of 59.05.
•	With average speed of Impact of 70.23 with survival rate of 0.51.

 # Findings:

•	The Male gender survived more than the female gender.
•	The age category Adult have more survival than the youth.
•	Those with safety kits survived more with 32 survival.
•	Those without safety kits survived less with 20 survival.
•	High Impact of speed cause high risk of accident.

# Problems:

•	Safety kits are not  properly use
•	The youths drive recklessly
•	Lack of road measure education
